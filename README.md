<h4> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Iacovos Kolokasis (nickname Jack). I am a 3rd-year PhD student
    in the 
    <a href="www.csd.uoc.gr">Computer Science Department at the University of Crete</a>, 
    working with <a href="https://users.ics.forth.gr/~bilas">Prof. Angelos Bilas</a>. 
    I am also a graduate research assistant in the 
    <a href="https://www.ics.forth.gr/carv/">Institute of Computer Science (ICS)</a> 
    at the 
    <a href="https://www.forth.gr/">Foundation of Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH)</a>. 
    I received my Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degrees in Computer Science from the
    University of Crete in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My main research
    interests fall at the intersection of managed programming languages and
    runtimes, memory, and storage systems. My work focuses on exploiting
    emerging non-volatile memories and fast block-addressable storage devices to
    improve heap efficiency in managed languages for data warehouse workloads,
    such as big-data analytics frameworks. My recent work resolves the tension
    between garbage collection and serialization/deserialization by providing a
    separate scanless managed heap over storage devices. It eliminates both
    garbage collection and serialization overheads without imposing any language
    restrictions.

  I am honored that my current work, during my doctoral studies, was awarded
  with the 
  <a href="https://research.facebook.com/fellows/kolokasis-iacovos-g/">Meta Research PhD Fellowship (2022-2024)</a> 
  and the <a href="https://www.cyscholarships.gov.cy/">State Scholarship Foundation of Cyprus (2020-2023).</a>
